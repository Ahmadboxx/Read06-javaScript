JavaScript  

For me JavaScript is a high level, interpreted, programming language used to make web pages more interactive.I have figured out that JavaScript is the language of the web, it is used to make the web look alive by adding motion to it.

To be more precise, it’s a programming language that let’s you implement complex and beautiful things/design on web pages.

HTML and CSS don’t have any programming mechanism. So, you need a scripting language through which you can implement programming concepts in your website.to use JavaScript for website you have to make JavaScript and link it with HTML page in which you add a script.

Feature of JavaScript

Scripting language and not Java: In fact, JavaScript has nothing to do with Java. Then why is it called “Java” Script? When JavaScript was first released it was called Mocha, it was later renamed to LiveScript and then to JavaScript when Netscape (founded JavaScript) and Sun did a license agreement.

Object-based scripting language which supports polymorphism, encapsulation and to some extent inheritance as well.

Interpreted language: It doesn’t have to be compiled like Java and C which require a compiler.

JavaScript runs in a browser: You can run it on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc. JavaScript can execute not only in the browser but also on the server and any device which has a JavaScript Engine.

What can JavaScript do?

JavaScript is mainly known for creating beautiful web pages & applications. An example of this is Google Maps.

JavaScript can also be used in smart watches.
